Hello, my name is Sebastián Rebaza and I'm a beginner programmer.
This repository stores files pertaining to several projects I'm developing.
This is mostly an introduction to more professional aspirations of mine, as well as what my superiors expect of me.
To contact me, send an e-mail to either sebastianrebaz@gmail.com or mannypardo.gensoupyo@gmail.com
